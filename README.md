End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a telecom company using SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning. The goal is to identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

Tech Stack

SQL Server: Data storage, ETL pipeline, and advanced querying.

Power BI: Interactive dashboards for data visualization.

Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Machine learning and data analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: Model training and evaluation.

Key Features

ETL Pipeline: Data ingestion, transformation, and loading in SQL Server.

Data Analysis & Visualization: Power BI dashboards for customer insights.

Churn Prediction Model: Random Forest classifier to identify potential churners.

Automated Workflow: End-to-end integration from data extraction to prediction.

Steps Involved

Data Preprocessing: Import and clean customer data.

ETL Process: Store structured data in SQL Server.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and patterns.

Dashboard Creation: Visualize churn distribution and key metrics.

Model Training: Train and evaluate a Random Forest model.

Prediction & Deployment: Use the model to predict customer churn.

Results

Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to track churn trends.

Achieved high prediction accuracy using Random Forest.

Identified key factors influencing customer churn.
